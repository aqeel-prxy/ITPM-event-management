University Event & Club Participation Management System

This project is developed as part of the IT3040 – IT Project Management (ITPM) module.
The system is designed to support university students by providing an easy way to
discover events, register or cancel participation, and track event involvement.

My individual contribution focuses on the Event Registration Module, which includes:
- Event listing and registration UI
- Validation rules to prevent duplicate and over-capacity registrations
- Participation history for students
- Automated end-to-end testing using Playwright

Project management and progress tracking were handled using Trello, and version control
was managed using GitHub with meaningful commits to demonstrate individual ownership.
